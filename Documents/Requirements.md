# Task 1: Requirement elicitation
## Task 1.1
### Domain Context
The Student Smart Printing Service (SSPS) is a system designed to serve the document printing process of students at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT) campuses. Catering to students across the Ly Thuong Kiet and Di An campuses, SSPS provides a streamlined, user-friendly, and cost-effective printing solution. This optimized system enhances efficiency and convenience, allowing students to focus more on their studies while effortlessly managing their printing needs. Additionally, the SSPS also includes tools for the Student Printing Service Officer (SPSO) to effectively manage printers, file types, and the allocation of A4 paper as printing currency for each student at each semester. This functionality promotes efficient resource utilization and ensures a smooth management process for the printing services at the university.

### Stakeholders and Needs
In today’s academic environment, especially at HCMUT, the demand for printing academic materials, references, and documents is substantial. Hard copies are essential for students’ studies, yet the primary method for printing these materials has been through external printing shops. While this approach sure has its merits, it also comes with several drawbacks: long travel distances to these shops, waiting times for printing completion, security risks when using outside services, and fluctuating prices that often vary from one shop to another. These challenges highlight the need for a more efficient and reliable printing service designed to satisfy the needs of students.

The stakeholders of this project include HCMUT students, the Student Printing Service Officer (SPSO) and the system administrator. Each of these stakeholders has their own demands for the system, which will be specified below.

The first group of stakeholders, HCMUT students (or students), includes all current students at the university, regardless of their degree program. Students seek a system that provides easy login access and the ability to upload their documents, along with customizable printing options. These features will enable students to print their materials as they prefer and access the printing service remotely. Additionally, the system must allow students to purchase additional A4 pages if their printing needs exceed the allotted quota using multiple online payment platform like BkPay. Finally, the students request a system that meets their security requirements by restricting access to their documents and allowing revisions of printing logs, which will help effectively track and manage their printing activities while alleviating security concerns.

The second group of stakeholders, the SPSO or Student Printing Service Officer are the university officers, who are responsible for managing the SSPS. To effectively carry out this role, they require a system that enables remote management of printers and oversight of the printing procedures within the university. The SPSO will also want to have access to usage history for reporting and analysis if the needs arise. Moreover, the configuration of other related properties, such as default A4 paper allocations date and amount, permitted file types, and more must also be available for SPSO. For ease of management, automated reports should also be generated at a specific interval, such as monthly or annually.

The third group of stakeholders, the system administrators (or administrators), consists of the university officers who are responsible for both the overall system administration and maintenance. They require an effective management system to help them with user authentication, manage user roles, as well as tools to monitor the update and maintenance of the system. For audit purposes, they also need access to the history of all the actions performed on the system by the administrators.

### Benifits of the system
The implementation of HCMUT - SSPS will offer numerous benefits tailored to each stakeholder. 

The students benefit from the system’s convenience, as they can quickly print documents from various locations without needing to visit a central printing center or multiple printers across campuses. Additionally, the customizable printing options cater to their specific needs, enhancing their overall experience. Better cost control can also be gained by monitoring their printing balances, helping to minimize waste and manage expenses effectively. By using the university's own printing service, security concerns are alleviated, as students no longer have to worry about the risk of information leaks associated with external photocopy shops. All of this ensures a convenient, efficient and risk-free printing process for HCMUT students.

For the Student Printing Service Officer (SPSO), the system enhances the management process by providing control over the printing operations, ensuring optimal resource allocation. Furthermore, automated report generation and logging features provide easier oversight and reduce documents related workloads for this stakeholder. All of these functionalities contribute to the better management of the system and service, allowing the SPSO to concentrate more on improving student services.

For the administrators of the system, the role management and system oversight tools offered by the system helps administrators to ensure the smooth operation of the system. The ability to access the history of all administration actions also adds in the transparency and accountability for the system, which helps with the administrative tasks. Additionally, the system’s health monitoring functions also help with proactive maintenance and updates, further boosting the performance of the system, reducing downtime and improving the overall user experience for all stakeholders.
