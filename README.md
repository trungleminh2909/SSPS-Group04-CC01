## Run frontend
To run the frontend of our project, you would need to do the following step:
1. Open the terminal of the project.
2. Enter `cd frontend` to open the frontend folder.
3. Enter `npm run dev` to run the frontend.
**Note:** We  assume that you downloaded `node.js` before.
## Run backend
Running backend using terminal is very complicated. Therefore, we encourge you to download the the `Extension Pack for Jave` via this link `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack` or by downloading `vscjava.vscode-java-pack` on VScode and run java.
